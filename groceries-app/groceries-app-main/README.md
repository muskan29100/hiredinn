## Problem Statement:

done by muskan malhotra

Create UI for an online grocery store.
It should have a banner section, and multiple sections (products section) according to different items (at least 5) on the main page.
Each section should scroll horizontally.
Add-to-cart functionality is required for every item.
The cart page should be there for grocery store where manipulation (add or remove or total) should exist.
Payment gateway and login functionality (up to you).
Each item in the respective section should be designed up to the mark.
